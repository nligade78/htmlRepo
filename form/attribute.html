<!-- Difference ID vs Class element -->
<!-- Multiple elements in HTMl can have the same class value, 
    whereas a value of id attribute must be unique -->

    <!-- Diff between div and span -->
    <!-- Div  is a block level element it's a type of section
    Creates a new line before and after itself by default-->

    <!-- span it's a inline element It doesn't create a new line it's used for applying style to specific part of text within large block -->
